I'm in Hollywood to meet photographer Joe Pugliese. I walk past star-studded sidewalks and restaurants you've seen a million times on movies and TV, but there are no celebrity sightings, just regular Angelenos going about their business. It's a fitting match for Joe’s photographs, which bridge the gap between stars and civilians by normalizing the celebrity and elevating the rest of us to a hero expression of ourselves.

Today, Joe is known for celebrity portraits of Jennifer Lopez, President Obama, Jamie Lee Curtis, and many others that appear in such publications as *Wired, Variety,* and *Texas Monthly,* but what most folks don’t know is that Joe got his start putting out a BMX zine using his mom’s Xerox machine, a starting point rooted in graphic design that continues to inform his practice even now.

**Alejandro Chavetta:** How did you get started as a photographer?

**Joe Pugliese:** In high school, I made a Xerox zine of me and my BMX friends. I was having a lot of fun with the graphic design and realized that I needed to take some photos for it, so I picked up a yard-sale camera.

I was still more interested in graphic design as I started shooting. And it was a little clumsy because I would shoot and then I would take it to the processing lab, wait a day or two, get back a print that would get messed up, or I wanted it to be bigger or smaller. Photography didn't click for me until I set up a darkroom. My parents let me black out the window in my bedroom, and I had another yard sale find of an enlarger and trays and caustic chemicals. It was the most rudimentary set-up.

I had a book that showed me how to develop in a dark room. The first time I put that print into the developer and nothing happened, I thought, "Total failure. Why did I bother with this?" And as I'm thinking about the failure, the print comes up, the image appears, and it was absolute magic. I wasn't a failure. I could shoot and be in control of the output from start to finish
