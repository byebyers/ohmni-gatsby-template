    It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body
    before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric - without a
    practical or visual reality. War taught me that not everything is glamorous.
    The difference between style and fashion is quality. War taught me that not
    everything is glamorous. War taught me that not everything is glamorous.

    Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses
    and in big clothes. That is the key of this collection, being yourself.
    Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you
    are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live. I
    think it's the responsibility of a designer to try to break rules and
    barriers. I try to contrast; life today is full of contrast... We have to
    change. For me, the summer will be pure gray - mother-of-pearl gray, very
    pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light
    blue, light turquoise, lots of pink.

I think the idea of mixing luxury and mass-market fashion is very modern, very now - no one wears head-to-toe designer anymore.
